# BMI-Rpackage

An R-package made from the code of my thesis project.

The .tar.gz file can be used to install the R-package on your computer.
The folder can be accessed to browse the package I have built.

The file `calculateAll.R` contains all the calculations performed in my thesis project with the functions in the R-package.
